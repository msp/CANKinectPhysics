h1. CAN Kinect Physics Tutorial for Processing

All examples tested and running in "Processing":http://processing.org (2.1.1). Needs the libraries listed in the original CAN article. I installed them through the built in Processing packager manager except "Toxiclibs":http://hg.postspectacular.com/toxiclibs/downloads/ which I installed by downloading 0020 and copying and flattening the sub directories directly into sketchbooks/libraries.

Forum thread:

All are examples are based upon Amnon's zip at the root of the forum thread. Respect!

They all build & run but 02 doesn't seem to run correctly.
The 03 source was copied from Modqhx post in the forum thread so credit to him for getting it running!

This repo will hopefuly save someone else some time if they're tryin to follow the article. Please fork at will.
