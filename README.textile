h1. CAN Kinect Physics Tutorial for Processing

All examples tested and running in "Processing":http://processing.org (2.1.1). Needs the libraries listed in the original CAN article. I installed them through the built in Processing packager manager except "Toxiclibs":http://hg.postspectacular.com/toxiclibs/downloads/ which I installed by downloading 0020 and copying and flattening the sub directories directly into sketchbooks/libraries.

All are examples are based upon Amnon's zip at the root of the forum thread. Respect!

They all build & run.
The 03 source was copied from Modqhx post in the forum thread so credit to him for getting it running!
